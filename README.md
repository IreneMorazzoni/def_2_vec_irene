# Def2Vec

The codebase for the paper "[Def2Vec: Learning Extensible Word Vectors from Definitions](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mjqknffjfhkw)".
For all the references, contributions, and credits, please refer to the paper.

This code was initially developed as part of the M.Sc. Thesis in Computer Science and Engineering "[Def2Vec: a model to extract word embeddings from dictionary definitions](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/179715)".
The M.Sc. degree was released by the Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingengeria  ([DEIB](https://www.deib.polimi.it/eng/home-page)) of the Politecnico di Milano University ([PoliMI](https://www.unitn.it)).
The Thesis was supervised at PoliMI by the staff of the [ARCSlab](https://arcslab.dei.polimi.it).

## Pre-trained model

We release a pre-trained model learned on the [English Wikitionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page).
The model is available at the following link: [download]().

## Example

The pre-trained model is compatible with the [Gensim API](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/).

```python

```

For further examples refer to the Jupyter Notebook available in this repository.
